# CPU Scheduler
A program that simulates the operation of the
process scheduler in a multiprocessor system and calculates some related statistics to
help improve the overall scheduling system.

# Introduction
Process scheduling is allocating resources to different processes so that they can be
completed in an efficient and timely manner. The main objectives of scheduling are to optimize the
use of resources, keep the CPU as busy as possible, have maximum utilization of the CPU, and
minimize response time and waiting time for processes being scheduled. One more objective in
multiprocessor systems is to ensure load balancing among different processors.
# Objectives
This was the project of the "Data Structures" course at Cairo University, Computer Engineering Department. It was aimed after the completion of this project that we will be able to:
* Understand unstructured, natural language problem descriptions and derive an appropriate design.
* Intuitively modularize a design into independent components and divide these components among team members.
* Build and use data structures to implement the proposed design.
* Write a complete object-oriented C++ program that performs a non-trivial task.
