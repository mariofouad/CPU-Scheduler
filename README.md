# Objectives
This was the project of the "Data Structures" course at Cairo University, Computer Engineering Department. It was aimed after the completion of this project that we will be able to:
* Understand unstructured, natural language problem descriptions and derive an appropriate design.
* Intuitively modularize a design into independent components and divide these components among team members.
* Build and use data structures to implement the proposed design.
* Write a complete object-oriented C++ program that performs a non-trivial task.
