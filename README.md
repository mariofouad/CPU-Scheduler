# Overview
This was the project of the "Logic Design" course at Cairo University, Computer Engineering Department. The circuits take two 4-bit signed numbers and make one of the four arithmetic operations on it; adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.
# How To Use
1. Download and install (Logisim)[https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/files/latest/download]
2. Download the Project files
3. Open the "Binary-Calculator" folder
4. Open the "ArithmeticLogicUnit" folder
5. Open the "Integration.circ" file using logisim and add the needed files
