# Overview
This was the project of the "Data Structures" course at Cairo University, Computer Engineering Department. It was aimed after the completion of this project that we will be able to:
* Understand unstructured, natural language problem descriptions and derive an appropriate design.
* Intuitively modularize a design into independent components and divide these components among team members.
* Build and use data structures to implement the proposed design.
* Write a complete object-oriented C++ program that performs a non-trivial task.
# Introduction
Process scheduling is allocating resources to different processes so that they can be completed in an efficient and timely manner. The main objectives of scheduling are to optimize the use of resources, keep the CPU as busy as possible, have maximum utilization of the CPU, and minimize response time and waiting time for processes being scheduled. One more objective in multiprocessor systems to ensure load balancing among different processors.
# How To Run
Using Visual Studio:
1. Download all files on your local machine.
2. Open the "CPU-Scheduler" folder.
3. Open the "CPUScheduler.sln" file, using Visual Studio.
4. Run the code (F5).
# How To Use
1. Enter the name of one of the test case files
2. Choose one of the interface modes; there are 3 interface modes available:
    * Interactive mode
    * Step-by-step mode
    * Silent mode
